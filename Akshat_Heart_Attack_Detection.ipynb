        "With AI forming the future of all complex decision-making, it is crucial to know how and why these decisions were made. Artificial Intelligence clearly enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human efforts. For example, AI techniques can be used to identify which transactions are likely to be fraudulent, as well as automate manually intense data management tasks in financial institutions, or it can be useful for face recognition in cameras.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, consider an AI-powered medical diagnosis system that predicts cancer or heart disease in a patient previously diagnosed as healthy by medical experts. Human life cannot be put to risk unless the predictions of the models are transparent and provide a legitimate reason for the result. If an AI system provides counterintuitive advice when picking stocks or an AI autonomous vehicle drives unpredictably and causes a fatal collision despite normal road conditions, then in such cases, itâ€™s essential to know why the model took the decisions and behaved in the way it did. This is where XAI comes into the picture. It has the potential to explain the underlying black-box processes and to provide trust in AI."
